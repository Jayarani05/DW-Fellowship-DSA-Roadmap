# 📘 Fellowship-2025 DSA Series

Welcome to the **Fellowship-2025 DSA Series**, an initiative by **Dev Weekends** to help learners become confident problem-solvers, build strong foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and crack technical interviews with ease.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This repository is not just about solving problems — it’s about:

- Learning **how to think** like a problem solver
- Understanding **core programming principles**
- Breaking down problems into patterns and strategies
- Practicing the **right amount of questions**
- Avoiding burnout from over-solving and under-learning

Whether you're a beginner or someone revisiting DSA for placements, this repo is your structured guide.

## 🚧 Before You Begin: Pre-Requisites

Before jumping into solving problems, it's crucial to cover the following **foundational skills**. These are mandatory if you want to **truly understand and apply** algorithms later:

### 📌 Programming Language Fundamentals (C++ , Python , Java)
- Variables, Data Types
- Loops & Conditionals
- Functions & Recursion
- I/O Operations
- Understanding References and Pointers

### 📌 Standard Libraries
- Their Usage and how to identify 

### 📌 Time & Space Complexity
- Big O Notation
- Analyzing loops and recursive calls

📁 All of the above are covered in the `Pre-Requisites/` folder. Make sure to go through it first.

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

This journey is based on **smart learning**, not brute force. Here's how to approach it:

### ✅ 1. Don’t Try to Solve Everything
> You’re not here to become a Leetcode farmer. You’re here to become a strong problem-solver.

Solve **5–10 solid problems per topic**, not 50 repetitive ones. Focus on learning techniques and patterns.

### ✅ 2. Learn Before You Apply
If a problem involves a new concept (e.g., recursion, hashmaps, DP), **go study that first** before attempting to solve the problem.

### ✅ 3. Solve > Struggle
Don’t spend more than **1 hour** on any one problem when starting out. If stuck:
- Read the editorial
- Watch a video
- Understand the approach
- Retry later

⏱ Ideal Time Per Problem: **30–45 minutes**

### ✅ 4. Backlog Tough Problems
Keep a separate list of problems you couldn't solve. Come back later once you've leveled up.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (Progressively)

| Level | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| Pre-Requisites | Help ypu Getting Started |
| Level 0 |
| Level 1 | Arrays, Strings, Recursion |
| Common | Shared logic, Maths , templates |

Each level contains its own `README.md` with topic-wise structure and references.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Fellowship-2025-DSA-Series/
├── Pre-Requisites/ # ✅ Start here — Basics of C++, Math, and Complexity
│ └── README.md

## 🧪 How to Practice

1. **Read the README** in each folder
2. Watch the linked reference video/notes (if provided)
3. Solve the listed problems in order
4. Document key learning in a notebook or markdown
5. Making a notion template will help you a lot
6. Review tricky problems weekly


Code is clean, well-commented, and beginner-friendly.

## 📢 Special Note

This repo is **not** meant to be a question dump. Each problem you solve should teach you a pattern. Once you finish this series, you’ll be equipped to tackle:

- Leetcode (Easy–Medium)
- Interview prep rounds (Product & Service companies)

Some considerations while starting with problem-solving till 100+ Leetcode problems are solved:

- Start with the most-easiest problems.
- DO NOT try to solve each problem yourself, instead try to learn and understand how different problems are being solved
- Do not try to solve a problem for more than 1 hour initially to get fast and to achieve more in less time, for any problem taking more than 1 hour, put it in a backlog and solve it later
- Average time to solve a problem should be 30-45 minutes
- Do not try to solve a lot of problems from one topic, instead try to solve 5-10 problems per topic
- Do not try to jump into problem-solving directly without the necessary pre-requisites, For example
- If you are trying to solve a problem that requires HashSet/HashMap then make sure you have studied HashMap before solving the problem If you are trying to solve a problem that uses recursion, first make sure you learn recursion properly If you are trying to solve a problem that uses graphs/trees, first make sure you learn graphs/trees properly If you are trying to solve a problem that uses dynamic programming, first make sure you learn dynamic programming properly.
